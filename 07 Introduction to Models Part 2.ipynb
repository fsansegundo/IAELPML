    "+ The nice thing about this is that we also have inference results about the difference of those means. For example, we have a p-value to tell us if the means of `SepalLength` for `Species = setosa`,  can be considered to be significantly different from that for  `Species = virginia` and `Species = versicolor`. To be precise, the null hypothesis being tested here is:\n",

    "\\quad\\\\\n",

    "and in particular the alternative is **not** all the three means are different, but *there are two of them that are different*. But if we reject that null, we can not yet identify a significantly different pair, because that brings ut back to the problem of multiple testing, and we know that this requires extra work that we will not make here."
